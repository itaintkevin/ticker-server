# Ticker

**Ticker is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) To-do List Web Application with User Authentication. It provides users with the ability to manage tasks, set their status, and assign priority levels. The project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux, ensuring a seamless user experience.**

**With Ticker, users can create an account, log in securely, and start managing their tasks effectively. The application allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, update their status, and set their priority levels. The intuitive user interface makes it easy for users to organize and prioritize their tasks efficiently.**

**The backend of Ticker is powered by Node.js and Express.js, which handle the API endpoints and authentication logic. MongoDB is used as the database to store user account information and task details. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are utilized for secure user authentication and authorization.**
